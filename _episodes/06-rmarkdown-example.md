This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used when writing a
lesson in RMarkdown.

This first chunk is really important, and should be included in all markdown lessons.



The rest of the lesson should be written as a normal RMarkdown file. You can
include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do:

Normal output:


~~~
1 + 1
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2
~~~
{: .output}

Output with error message:


~~~
x[10]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}

Output generating figures:


~~~
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat,  y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point()
~~~
{: .r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-plot-example-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot-example" alt="plot of chunk plot-example" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to the where
the `>` go and where to leave blank lines. Otherwise, you can include chunks in
it to include instructions and solutions.
